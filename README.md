# login-ad
This is a PUBLIC github repo that contains the copy that appears on our application web site login page.

This repo is also being used to contain the copy displayed in our bill-minder nag banners. These are messages displayed to clients who are behind on paying their bills.

Access is restricted. You may request access from the usual suspects.

Changes to files in the `draft` branch will be shown automatically in Dev/Staging/QA environments.

Following an accepted pull request from `draft` into `master`, copy will be displayed in Production and ClientTest.

There may be a delay of several minutes before the new copy appears. Our application web site caches the content from GitHub and expires it every so often, after which it will pull fresh content.
