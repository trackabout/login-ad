**Daylight Savings Time in TrackAbout**

**Important reminder:**


For those countries who observe daylight savings time, no matter when it is, it is very important to make sure to dock or sync your device to make sure that it has pulled in the correct new time. This should be done before using your devices; handhelds, smartphones, or tablets, for the first time after the time change.  This will prevent time sync issues.

In the United States, Daylight Savings Time begins at 2:00 am local time on the second Sunday in March and continues until the first Sunday in November, when it returns to standard time at 2:00 am.  Other parts of the world also participate in Daylight Savings during different times of the year.
