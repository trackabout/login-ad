## TrackAbout Mobile 7

* **Android and iOS** — We’ve rebuilt TrackAbout Mobile 7 for iOS and Android to use Microsoft .Net 8, upgrading from .Net 6. Along with general improved performance, stability, and compatibility, the move to .Net 8 comes with an updated and improved signature screen, improved barcode scanning, and improved push notifications.

* **Delivery with Integrated Order Sync** — Orders can now be sorted by how close the customer is to the mobile device TrackAbout 7 is running on.

NOTE: This feature requires the mobile device has location services enabled for TrackAbout Mobile 7, and that the customer’s GPS coordinates have been entered into TrackAbout manually or through ERP integration.

For help setting up this feature, contact TrackAbout Support.

* **Add New** — Option-based Key Fields now display correctly when using Save and Add More.
  
* **Push Notifications** — Spaces in trip numbers no longer prevent push notifications from being sent.
