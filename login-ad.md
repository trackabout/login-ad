Do you find yourself struggling to manage, research, and fix Unknown and Unclassified assets within your TrackAbout environment?

 - An Unclassified Asset is an Asset that is being tracked in TrackAbout, but it has not been defined or classified. The Asset has been scanned or recorded within TrackAbout without any details regarding what kind of Asset it is (Cylinder, Dumpster, Generator, Tote, Trailer, Wheelchair?)
 - An Unknown Asset is the step before it is even unclassified, meaning the asset has never been scanned or recorded into TrackAbout at all.

**<span style="color:#ff9902">Join Sonya Becker, TrackAbout's Customer Success Specialist,</span> for a FREE webinar on Wednesday, September 23, 2020**, to learn how to stop Unknowns and Unclassifieds from even being created.
Additionally, we’ll cover the following bonus items:

 - Add New with Lookup – Fewer collisions, better accuracy of assets.
 - Key Fields - Require key fields for uniqueness, cutting down on collisions. "Key Fields" include Serial Number, Manufacturer, and Manufacturer Date.
 - Secondary Add New - An Add New can also be performed from within other actions.
