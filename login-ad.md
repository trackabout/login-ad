# What's new: Test Environment 2025 Release Notes 

**TrackAbout Web » Management Reports » Rental Chatbot** — Get insight into your rental revenue with the help of AI. The new, interactive Rental Chatbot uses the rental and revenue data gathered by TrackAbout to generate reports and to provide AI-powered interactive business analysis.

**TrackAbout Web » Regular Maintenance » Verification** — Verification no longer shows deleted orders when comparing against New Orders, letting you focus on actual undelivered orders without getting distracted by orders that were already deleted from the system.

**TrackAbout Web » Regular Maintenance » Sync Problems** — Fixed bug preventing retry of Unload Truck sync problems. Users can now successfully retry failed truck unloads from the Sync Problems page without receiving parsing errors.

**TrackAbout Web » Open Inventory Audit** — You can now export the missing asset and counted asset reports as an Excel (.xls) file directly from the  _Inventory Audit - Missing Assets_  or  _Inventory Audit - Counted Assets_  page, respectively.

**TrackAbout Web » Orders » Order Planning** — You can now do order planning on maintenance orders just like deliveries. The Order Planning page has been updated to let you select what type of orders are shown in the Order Planning report, Delivery Orders and/or Maintenance Orders. You can also include completed maintenance orders and delivered delivery orders.

**TrackAbout Mobile 7 » Sort Container**  — Fixed bug where detaching assets from delivery records incorrectly removed unrelated assets from their containers. Assets now remain properly contained when other assets are detached from records.

**TrackAbout Mobile 7 » Dynamic Forms** — Added pattern matching for dynamic form fields. Users can now scan composite barcodes and automatically extract specific values (like lot numbers) based on configured patterns, eliminating manual data entry errors. To enable this feature, contact TrackAbout Support.

**TrackAbout Mobile » Delivery** — An issue that intermittently prevented PDFs of HTML delivery receipts from being generated and emailed has been corrected.

**API » /orders/maintenance/new** & **/orders/maintenance/complete/new** — We've changed the default behavior of these calls so that the system re-sends confirmed maintenance and "maintenance completed" records if they are changed after being confirmed. This behavior can be changed by TrackAbout Support.
