## <a id="bm1"> </a> Sort Assets with TAM7

Previously only available in TrackAbout Mobile 6, Sort Assets (aka Inspection Scan) is now available in TrackAbout Mobile 7 for iOS and Android.

The Sort Assets action lets you scan multiple assets to mark that they’re ready for filling or another action (by changing their use state). As part of the review, you can flag them for follow-up maintenance (using an integrated Send to Maintenance action).

##  <a id="bm2"></a> Send to Maintenance comes to TrackAbout Mobile 7

The Send to Maintenance action (aka Flag for Maintenance) is now available in TrackAbout Mobile 7 (iOS and Android).

Send to Maintenance lets you flag a single asset at a time for maintenance and record the reasons why maintenance is needed, all in one action. This can be useful for times when maintenance can’t immediately be done, or maintenance is routinely handled by others.

##  <a id="bm3"></a> Centralized Custom Asset Info Option (CAI) Management

##  <a id="bm5"></a> More Flexible Custom Actions

[Dynamic Forms](https://meta.trackabout.com/wiki/Dynamic_Forms) can now come anywhere in a custom generic action, not just at the end, making TrackAbout’s [Dynamic Workflows](https://meta.trackabout.com/wiki/Dynamic_Workflow) even more useful and generic actions more adaptable to your workflow.

##  <a id="bm6"></a> Bulk Load Users: Format Changes and New Options

Bulk Load Users (Jump To: _Bulk Load Users_) lets you add and make changes to internal users in batches instead of one at a time using a specially formatted Excel workbook.

With this release, we’ve tweaked the format of the workbook to make it even easier to use by merging the _Roles and Permissions_ worksheet into the _User Information_ worksheet.

We’ve also added an option to let you select how users are identified in the workbook.

##  <a id="bm7"></a> Korean Language Support

TrackAbout.com and the TrackAbout Mobile 7 app (for iOS and Android) now support the Korean language.



##  <a id="bm8"></a> Quality of Life Improvements

 - Having multiple lines in an order with the same product code no longer causes Branch Transfer Send on TAM7 to error out. 
 - An issue for some users that caused TrackAbout to stay in a “TrackAbout is working hard” state for an excessive length of time when saving an edited product code has been corrected. 
 - Exports of Asset Searches by location-restricted user no longer inadvertently contain assets outside the user’s location.
