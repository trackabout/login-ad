## Important reminder: Daylight Saving Time in TrackAbout

For those countries who observe daylight saving time, it is **very important** to make sure to dock or sync your Windows CE or Windows Mobile devices to ensure correct clock time. This should be done first thing the morning after the Daylight Saving Time change-over. This will help prevent time sync issues.

Smartphones and tablets running iOS and Android will automatically update their clocks for Daylight Saving Time, provided they have been properly configured for the country and time zone in which they operate.

In the United States, Daylight Saving Time begins at *2:00 AM local time on Sunday, March 8th*. It continues until *2:00 AM local time on Sunday, November 1st*.

Other parts of the world participate in Daylight Saving during different times of the year. You can find your country's policy [Daylight Saving Time by Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_by_country).
