# What's New for April 2023


## Not Scanned Asset Support added to Customer Audits

*Customer Audits* on TrackAbout Mobile 7 can now include Not Scanned Assets in addition to scanned assets.

**Note:** Not-Scanned assets are only supported when: Customer Audits is in Online mode, and only a single customer location is being audited

There are three options for how Customer Audits include Not Scanned Assets to choose from:

* Customer Audits do not include Not Scanned Assets.
* Customer Audits include all Not Scanned Assets.
* Customer Audits include Not Scanned Assets that are not in a fully tracked asset family.

Contact TrackAbout Support (support@trackabout.com) to change your current option. 


## Clear Complaints using TrackAbout Mobile 7
You can now clear complaints (aka blocks) on assets in maintenance straight from your smart device using TrackAbout Mobile 7.

Removing a complaint / block on an asset in maintenance clears the asset to be put back into circulation. 

The option to clear complaints / blocks is in TrackAbout Mobile 7's Maintenance action: 

1. Tap an asset in *Maintenance* to select it, then tap NEXT to open *Maintenance to Perform*.

2. On the *Maintenance to Perform* screen, tap *Clear Complaint / Block* in addition to any other action(s). 

3. Tap NEXT to return to the main *Maintenance* screen.

4. On the *Maintenance* screen, tap NEXT to remove the complaint / block from the asset and exit *Maintenance*.


## New Branch Transfer Verification Options
We've added new options for how Branch Transfers are verified.

* *Ignore Both* — Deliver and return quantities don't have to match what's in the accounting system and are automatically approved.
* *Delivers and Returns Match* — Transfers are approved only if both deliver and return quantities must match what's in the accounting system. 
* *Delivers Match, Returns Ignored* — Transfers are approved only if deliver quantities match what's in the accounting system for approval. Return quantities don't have to match. 
* *Returns Match, Delivers Ignored* — Transfers are approved only if return quantities match what's in the accounting system. Deliver quantities don't have to match.

## Pause Generic Actions
We've added a new option for actions which can be used to effectively pause generic actions to be completed at a later time or by another person. This can be useful for actions such as Maintenance, where work on an asset may be spread over days and different shifts/departments. For information on using this new option, contact TrackAbout Support (support@trackabout.com).


## Fixes
* The Rental Bill Generation Progress bar not displaying correctly in some cases. (TrackAbout Web > Rental > Rental Billing Period Dashboard)
* Signatures on delivery receipts too small to read when printed on 4-inch printers.
* Lot lines on delivery receipts overlapping when printed on 4-inch printers.
