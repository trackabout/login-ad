# New for February

## TrackAbout Web

* **Mobile Unit Push Notifications** — You can now send announcements or other messages to all of your TrackAbout Mobile 7 users through the TrackAbout website. When sent, the message appears as a notification on the user’s Android or iOS device where they have TrackAbout Mobile 7 installed.
Messages can be sent through the new [Mobile Units Push Notifications](https://supportkb.trackabout.com/Content/Source/TAdotCOM-UG/MobileUnits/MobileUnitsPushNotifications.htm) page (TrackAbout Web > Mobile Units).
Contact TrackAbout Support for assistance in turning on this feature.
* **Customers** — The Reassign page has a new name, Change Customer Relationships, to better reflect its purpose and use.
* **Documentation** — The Help/Wiki link has been renamed Help and now opens the TrackAbout Knowledge Base instead of the deprecated TrackAbout Wiki.
