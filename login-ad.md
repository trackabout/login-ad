 * **Truck Inventory** — The new Truck Inventory action gives drivers an up-to-date report about what’s on their truck while they’re on a trip. 
Truck Inventory works once a truck has been loaded (using Load Truck), and shows details including  the number of unique tracked assets and not-scanned items which have  already been delivered during the trip, as well as the trips undelivered and pre-cancelled orders.
Shown details include:
	 * Empties and fulls 
	 * Lot Numbers
Truck Inventory works whether or not TrackAbout Mobile 7 is connected to the internet.
Truck Inventory must be enabled by TrackAbout Support.


* **Delivery (with Integrated Order Sync)** — Delivery (with Integrated Order Sync) can now be set to show all orders for a trip regardless on their status: delivered, undelivered, or cancelled (i.e. pre-cancelled).

To enable this option, contact TrackAbout Support.

* **Generic Actions** — TrackAbout can now create generic actions that can be run while TrackAbout Mobile 7 is offline and the iOS/Android device is not connected to the internet.
